## STRIDE Threat Analysis

### Boundary A: Client ↔ API

| Threat | Scenario | Impact | Current Mitigations | Residual Risk | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing** | Attacker forges a JWT or steals a token to impersonate a user | Account takeover, unauthorised access | JWT signed with HS256 (`JWT_SECRET`); JTI revocation set for logout; token expiry (7d); `authenticate` middleware verifies signature + expiry on every request; httpOnly cookie recommended over localStorage | Medium — token theft via XSS still possible if frontend uses localStorage | [#767] Migrate frontend to httpOnly cookies |
| **Tampering** | Attacker modifies request body to bypass validation or escalate role | Data corruption, privilege escalation | Zod validation schemas on all inputs; `sanitize` middleware strips XSS + blocks SQLi patterns + prototype pollution; `authorize` middleware enforces role gates | Low | — |
| **Repudiation** | User denies performing an action | No audit trail for disputes | `audit.ts` middleware logs action type + userId + IP + timestamp on every state-mutating call; idempotency keys prevent duplicate action claims | Low | — |
| **Information Disclosure** | Token or password leaked in logs, headers, or error messages | Credential exposure | Pino HTTP logger configured to exclude `password`, `token`, `Authorization`; `sanitizeUser` strips sensitive fields from API responses; error handler returns generic messages for internal errors | Low | — |
| **Denial of Service** | Attacker floods auth endpoints to lock out legitimate users | Service unavailability | `authRateLimiter` (10 req / 15 min on login/register); `userRateLimit` with Redis + exponential backoff; `generalRateLimit` (200 req / 15 min auth); Helmet CSP blocks script injection | Medium — no global DDoS protection | [#768] Add Cloudflare / WAF rate limiting |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Attacker modifies `role` claim in JWT or exploits missing role checks | Admin access | JWT signed server-side (cannot modify claims); `authorize` middleware checks `req.user.role` against required roles on every admin route; role is a non-mutable DB field | Low | — |

### Boundary B: API ↔ Database

| Threat | Scenario | Impact | Current Mitigations | Residual Risk | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing** | Attacker connects to DB with stolen credentials | Full data breach | DB connection uses least-privilege user; credentials stored in Vault, never in code; internal network only (not exposed publicly) | Low | — |
| **Tampering** | SQL injection via raw queries | Data exfiltration / corruption | Prisma uses parameterised queries by default; `$queryRaw` enforces tagged template literals; sanitize middleware blocks SQLi patterns as defence-in-depth | Low | — |
| **Repudiation** | DBA denies making manual changes | Loss of forensic trail | `AuditLog` table captures application-level actions; database audit logging via PostgreSQL `audit` extension (TBD) | Medium | [#769] Enable PostgreSQL audit logging |
| **Information Disclosure** | DB dump exposes password hashes / tokens | Credential compromise | Passwords hashed with Argon2id (memory-hard); verification/reset tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes (raw token only in email); refresh tokens are opaque random values | Low | — |
| **Denial of Service** | Connection pool exhaustion | API outage | Prisma connection pooling with `connection_limit`; monitoring alerts on connection count; `kubectl rollout restart` runbook for immediate recovery | Medium | [#770] Add connection pool autoscaling |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | DB user has excessive grants | Unauthorised schema changes | DB user restricted to `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` on application tables; schema migrations run separately with elevated credentials | Low | — |

### Boundary C: API ↔ Stellar (Horizon)

| Threat | Scenario | Impact | Current Mitigations | Residual Risk | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing** | Attacker runs a fake Horizon node | Incorrect contract state or transaction rejection | API connects to known Horizon URLs (configurable via env); Stellar network signatures validate transaction results | Low | — |
| **Tampering** | Man-in-the-middle modifies transaction XDR | Funds misdirected | All mutating contract calls use `require_auth()` — Stellar enforces caller signature on every operation; API constructs XDR locally and only submits signed transactions | Low | — |
| **Information Disclosure** | On-chain data analysis reveals user behaviour | Privacy loss | `location_hash` and `contact_hash` are SHA-256 digests (not plaintext); wallet addresses are public by design on Stellar | Medium (accepted) | — |
| **Denial of Service** | Horizon rate limits throttle API | Payment/registration delays | Retry logic with exponential backoff in payment service; monitoring alerts on Horizon error rates | Medium | [#771] Add Horizon failover to secondary node |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Contract admin key used from API (if stored in env) | Full contract compromise | Admin key should NOT be stored in API env — contracts require `require_auth()` so the API cannot impersonate the admin | Medium if misconfigured | [#772] Audit that no admin keys are in API env |

### Boundary D: User Wallet ↔ Soroban Contracts

| Threat | Scenario | Impact | Current Mitigations | Residual Risk | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing** | Attacker registers a worker under someone else's wallet address | Identity theft | `register()` requires `curator.require_auth()` (curator-gated); `owner` address is set at registration and immutable; wallet auth is required for all mutating functions | Low | — |
| **Tampering** | Integer overflow in reward / fee calculations | Incorrect payouts | All arithmetic uses Rust `checked_add`, `checked_sub`, `checked_mul`, `checked_div` with panic on overflow | Low | — |
| **Repudiation** | Worker denies receiving a tip or escrow release | Unresolved payment dispute | Every state change emits an event (`TipSent`, `EscRel`, `EscCnl`, etc.) — on-chain events are immutable; dispute contract provides formal arbitration path | Low | — |
| **Information Disclosure** | Contract storage enumeration reveals reputation inputs | Gaming of reputation system | `ReputationInputs` are stored on-chain and publicly readable by design (Soroban) — gating is considered but defered | Medium (accepted) | [#773] Evaluate private reputation storage |
| **Denial of Service** | Gas griefing — attacker submits many micro-transactions | Network fee spikes | Soroban charges fees per operation; `batch_register` capped at 20; paginated read functions (`list_workers_paginated`, `list_workers_page`) prevent read-entry DoS | Low | — |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Curator or admin key compromise leads to unauthorised role grants | Full contract takeover | RBAC with `require_role` on all privileged functions; `propose_upgrade` has 48-hour timelock; `ROLE_UPGRADER` should be a multisig in production | Critical if key lost | [#774] Implement multisig for all admin roles on mainnet |

### Boundary E: API ↔ Admin Panel

| Threat | Scenario | Impact | Current Mitigations | Residual Risk | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing** | Stolen admin JWT used to access admin panel | Full API admin access | `authenticate` + `authorize('admin')` on all `/api/admin/*` routes; JWT expiry (7d); JTI revocation on logout | Medium | [#767] httpOnly cookies |
| **Tampering** | Admin performs destructive action (bulk delete, ban) | Data loss | Admin routes are idempotent where possible; all admin actions logged to `AuditLog`; confirmation flows for destructive actions in UI | Low | — |
| **Information Disclosure** | Admin exports user data CSV | Mass PII leak | Export routes rate-limited (1/min); data includes only necessary fields; `sanitizeUser` strips sensitive fields | Medium | [#775] Add admin action approval workflow for exports |
| **Denial of Service** | Admin triggers expensive query (unpaginated list) | DB performance degradation | Admin list endpoints use pagination (offset/limit); monitoring on query latency | Low | — |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Curator exploits admin panel bug to escalate to admin | Unauthorised admin access | Role is server-verified via JWT + DB check on every request; no client-side role trust | Low | — |

### Boundary F: API ↔ S3/CDN (File Uploads)

| Threat | Scenario | Impact | Current Mitigations | Residual Risk | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing** | Attacker uploads file impersonating another user | Unauthorised content | Uploads gated by `authenticate` middleware; file ownership checked in controller | Low | — |
| **Tampering** | Malicious file upload (polyglot, SVG with XSS) | Stored XSS / server compromise | Multer validates MIME type; Sharp re-encodes images (strips metadata); 5MB size limit; files served from separate CDN domain (no script execution) | Low | — |
| **Denial of Service** | Large file upload exhausts disk / memory | Storage exhaustion | 5MB limit; Sharp streams processing (no full-buffer); S3 has unlimited scale | Low | — |

## Key Custody & Admin Powers

### Contract Admin Keys

| Role | Power | Custody Recommendation | Current Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ROLE_ADMIN` | Grant/revoke any role; set admin; migrate storage; withdraw fees | Hardware wallet (Ledger) or multisig | Single key on testnet; multisig planned for mainnet |
| `ROLE_UPGRADER` | Replace contract WASM (immediate or 48h timelock) | Multisig (3-of-5) | Timelock is 48h on Registry; immediate on other contracts |
| `ROLE_PAUSER` | Pause/unpause all contract operations | Separate key from admin | Follows admin key currently |
| `ROLE_CURATOR_MGR` | Add/remove curators | Admin-delegated | Admin holds this |
| `ROLE_FEE_MANAGER` | Update protocol fee (max 500 bps) | Admin-delegated | Admin holds this |
| `ROLE_CLAIMS_MGR` | Approve/reject/pay insurance claims | Operational key | Separate from admin |

### API Admin Powers

| Action | Gated By | Audit Trail |
|---|---|---|
| User suspend / unsuspend / ban | `authenticate` + `authorize('admin')` | `AuditLog` entry |
| Worker bulk toggle / delete | Same | `AuditLog` entry + idempotency key |
| User / worker CSV export | Same + rate-limited (1/min) | `AuditLog` entry |
| Worker CSV import | Same + Multer 5MB | `AuditLog` entry |
| Review moderation (approve/reject) | Same | `AuditLog` entry |
| Dispute review | Same | `AuditLog` entry |

### Key Rotation

| Secret | Rotation Cadence | Method | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Quarterly or on compromise | Vault rotation script | Invalidates all sessions — plan 24h migration window |
| Database password | Monthly | Vault rotation script | Brief connection drain on rotation |
| AWS credentials | Every 90 days | IAM key rotation | Requires pod restart |
| Stellar admin keys | Only on compromise | Transfer `set_admin` to new address | Instant — no downtime |

## Abuse Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Sybil Curator Attack

**Description**: A malicious curator registers fake worker profiles to spam the platform, boost fake reputations, or scam clients.

**Impact**: Low-quality listings erode trust; clients may send tips to fake workers.

**Mitigations**:
- Curators are added only by `ROLE_CURATOR_MGR` (a restricted admin role)
- Each registration requires `curator.require_auth()` — the Stellar network verifies the curator signed the transaction
- Off-chain: curator identity should be KYC'd before `add_curator` is called (process not in code)
- On-chain: `batch_register` capped at 20 workers per call to limit blast radius
- Reviews require a real authenticated user account; fake reviews can be flagged and moderated by admins

**Residual Risk**: Medium — if a curator key is compromised or a malicious actor becomes a curator, they can register unlimited workers until detected.

**Follow-up**: [#776] Add curator reputation/gatekeeping (e.g., bonding, time-locks, DAO vote).

### Scenario 2: Fake Listings & Impersonation

**Description**: An attacker creates a worker profile impersonating a real business or using stolen photos.

**Impact**: Fraud against clients; reputational damage to impersonated workers.

**Mitigations**:
- Curator-gated registration (not self-service)
- Location verification (`verify_location`) with expiry — can be challenged
- Category verification by curators with expiry
- Badge system allows trusted issuers to mark verified workers
- Off-chain: admin can suspend/ban users; workers can be bulk-deleted
- On-chain review system: low ratings auto-slash reputation (< 3000 bps)

**Residual Risk**: Medium — verification is optional; unverified workers can still be listed.

**Follow-up**: [#777] Mandate at least one verification type (location or category) before listing in search.

### Scenario 3: Admin Key Compromise

**Description**: Attacker gains access to a Stellar contract admin key (single point of failure).

**Impact**: Complete contract takeover — upgrade to malicious WASM, drain escrows, grant arbitrary roles.

**Mitigations**:
- `ROLE_UPGRADER` on Registry has a 48-hour timelock (anyone can monitor and cancel)
- All privileged functions require `require_auth()` — even admin must sign each call
- Recommended multisig setup for mainnet (not yet enforced in code)
- Admin transfer (`set_admin`) requires current admin auth

**Residual Risk**: Critical — without multisig, a single key compromise is catastrophic.

**Follow-up**: [#774] Implement on-chain multisig for admin roles before mainnet.

### Scenario 4: Escrow Abuse

**Description**: Payer creates escrow with insufficient expiry, then cancels before worker completes; or worker never releases escrow after job completion.

**Impact**: Worker unpaid for completed work; payer loses funds.

**Mitigations**:
- Either party can `release_escrow` (both `from` and `to` can trigger release)
- Payer can only `cancel_escrow` after expiry timestamp
- `cancel_expired_escrow` is callable by anyone (prevents stuck funds)
- Arbitration flow: either party can `request_arbitration` with an approved arbitrator
- Multi-sig escrows require threshold approvals before release

**Residual Risk**: Low — arbitration covers edge cases.

### Scenario 5: API Privilege Escalation

**Description**: A curator user exploits an API bug to perform admin actions.

**Impact**: Unauthorised data access, user bans, data export.

**Mitigations**:
- Role is signed into JWT at login (cannot be modified client-side)
- `authorize('admin')` middleware checks role on every request
- Roles map to numeric enums in DB; no inheritance ambiguity
- Admin routes are a separate file with explicit guards

**Residual Risk**: Low.
